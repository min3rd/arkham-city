API handle flow

Notice:
- We use response interceptor to format all response to template, so we no need do format in service or controller, just focus into bussiness process
    ```json
    {
        "error": false,
        "timestamp": "2025-03-16T08:29:22.730Z",
        "data" : {}
    }
    ```
- It may be hard to understand how microservice working, but we can simplize that: we have more than 1 microservice which subscribe message "A", when a service call help by message "A" then 1 of which subscribed can do process and return the output. Just imagine, that will make sence when our system become bigger than google, and that is the way we can deploy our system.
